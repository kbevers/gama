GNU Gama NEWS - History of user-visible changes.

Version 2.03 February 2019

* The new attribute "extern" suggested by Kristian Evers (Danish
  Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency) was added both to the
  gama-local xml input and adjustment results xml output to be
  conformant with FIRE project.

  FIRE, short for FIkspunktREgister, is a complex of applications that
  is used by the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency to
  manage the geodetic levelling networks in the Kingdom of
  Denmark. Managing the levelling network requires both physical
  maintenance on geodetic markers, determination of coordinates of
  said markers and distributing data about the markers and their
  coordinates to surveyors in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe
  Islands.

  Central to FIRE is an Oracle database that stores all relevant data
  on levelling benchmarks and other geodetic stations, as well as
  geodetic observations and coordinates related to them. FIRE is
  primarily developed in Python 3. The core of FIRE is the database
  and an API that allow other software modules to interface with the
  database in a simple fashion while still maintaining the required
  data integrity. Where possible existing open source software
  solutions are used instead of developing them in-house. Examples of
  that are PROJ which is used for coordinate transformations and Gnu
  Gama which is used for adjustment of geodetic levelling networks.

Version 2.02 November 2018

* Improved Hungarian translation by Siki Zoltan:
   "I would like to inform you that we just have finished a guide to
   networks used in engineering surveying. It will be a booklet of the
   Hungarian Chamber of Engineers. It mostly contains practical guide of
   the network adjustment and blunders detection. In the examples GNU
   Gama was used (and GeoEasy).
   During this work we have improved the Hungarian translation."

Version 2.01 September 2018

* Maintainer's release
* Conditional build for gama-g3 enabled implicitly
* XML schema definition for gama-g3 adjustment results with new
  xmllint testsuite

Version 2.00 May 2018

* Maintainer's release: for the list of internal changes see ChangeLog

Version 1.21 November 2017

* Maintainer's release : internal matrix/vectors memory management
  replaced with a new implementation using C++11 move constructor and
  move asignment syntax.

Version 1.20 November 2017

* New test suite for matvec classes and support for valgrind memory
  leak tests for tests/matvec and tests/gama-local.

     This release is a preperation phase for the next release in which
     the base matvec memory handling class (MemRep) will reimplemented
     with C++11 move constructor and move assignemnt operator.

Version 1.19 June 2017

* fixed a bug introduced in 1.16, reported by Pierre Bosser
        <pierre.bosser@ensta-bretagne.fr>. Implicit value of
        covariance band in XML adjustment output is -1 (full
        bandwidth).

Version 1.18 August 2016

* configure.ac : patch by Greg Troxel <gdt@lexort.com>
     CPPFLAGS was set with +=, which is a bash extension and fails on
     POSIX-conforming shells.  This resulted in sqlite3 support not being
     enabled on NetBSD, even though the sqlite3 library was found and
     linked in.
* fixed some minor problems reported by Greg Troxel (doc, NEWS)
* in local/network.cpp commented out // removed_obs.clear();
* fixed a formatting bug in outlaying terms (due to c++11)
* fixed a bug in HTML parser test
* simplified class LocalPoint
* fixed a bug in sql export reported by Dominik Hladik
* added @documentencoding UTF-8 into gama.texi

Version 1.17 November 2015

* new set of functions for handling inconsistent systems
* fixed two bugs reported by Greg Troxel

Version 1.16 July 2015

* minor fixes in documentation
* fixed a bug in SQL schema
* new export of XML network definition
* C++11 features enabled (-std=c++11 for g++ compiler)
* fixed several minor bugs

Version 1.15 February 2014

* DTD replaced with XSD for gama-local.xsd and
  gama-local-adjustment.xsd. Attribute version describing XML version
  of input and adjustment outpup XML documents became useles with
  introduction of XSD a was removed from tags <gama-local> and
  <gama-local-adjustment>. Some more elements attributes were
  introduced in revised XML formats which are incompatible with older
  versions.

Version 1.14 June 2013

* A posteriori standard deviation Chi-Square test is newly always
  performed (even when gama-local uses a priori reference standard
  deviation).

* Added Chinese translation in GBK encoding (switch "zh")

* New output format XHTML Strict 1.0 in gama-local

* Added a basic test suite for gama-local (make check).
